I'm a second year PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Bern. My main research interests are in the field of Applied Public Economics, especially empirical Health Economics. 

## Work in Progress
### Interpersonal Discontinuities in Primary Care: A Study of Practice Handovers (with Tamara Bischof and Boris Kaiser) 2022
We study practice handovers in Switzerland during the period 2007 - 2015 to analyse the impact of interpersonal discontinuities in primary care on patients' health care utilization, health-related outcomes and costs. Handovers typically arise when a general practitioner (GP) retires and sells his practice to a younger successor. We exploit rich insurance claims data to construct a panel data set covering roughly 220,000 patients observed for at least six years.
Employing a dynamic difference-in-difference framework, we estimate the causal effects of the handover by comparing the differences in outcomes of interest between patients that experience a handover and a similar group of patients that does not. 
We find that discontinuities of care increase outpatient health care utilization, which is especially large for specialist visits (+5.5\%). As a consequence, ambulatory costs increase as well (+5.2\%). These changes in the utilization pattern are likely to be driven by differences in practice styles between retiring GPs and their successors who are typically much younger and more likely to be female. In contrast to the existing literature on interpersonal continuity of care, we find no evidence for adverse health effects. Consistent with more recent findings, we conclude that an exogenous disruption to the patient-provider relation is not necessarily harmful.
