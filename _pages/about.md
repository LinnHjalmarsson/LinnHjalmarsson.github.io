Hi, thanks for dropping by. I recently finished my PhD in Economics at the University of Bern and I am currently working as a researcher at the CSS Institute for Empirical Health Economics. My main research interests are in the field of Applied Public Economics, especially empirical Health Economics. 

## Publications
[The impact of physician exits in primary care: A study of practice handovers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2023.104867) with [Boris Kaiser](https://sites.google.com/site/kaisereconomics/home) and [Tamara Bischof](https://sites.google.com/view/tamarabischof/home) (Health Policy, 2023, Vol 135)

Recent studies on physician exits suggest that general practitioners (GPs) have an important impact on health care utilization and costs, but the transmission channels - interpersonal dis- continuities of care, practice style differences and deterioration in access - are usually not clear. Our objective is to estimate the short-run and long-run impacts of switches in GPs on patients’ health care utilization and costs, while all other factors of the health care setting remain the same. To do this, we collect data on handovers of primary care practices in Switzerland, occurring between 2007 and 2015. We link this data to rich insurance claims to construct a panel dataset of roughly 240,000 patients. Employing a difference-in-difference type framework, we find transitory increases in overall visits and costs, which are likely caused by the entering GP's initial re-assessment of patients’ health care needs. Additionally, we find long-term increases in specialist health care utilization and ambulatory costs. The latter finding can be explained by changes in practice styles between the exiting GP and her successor, who is typically much younger and more likely to be female. In contrast to the literature on practice closures, we do not find evidence on reduced overall utilization rates. An important lesson for health policy is thus to preserve patients’ access to care in the case of GP exits.

## Work in Progress
[A Prescription for Knowledge: Patient Information and Generic Substitution](https://edoc.unibas.ch/96408/1/2024_05_A_Prescription_for_Knowledge_Patient_Information_and_Generic_Substitution.pdf) (with Nicolas Schreiner and Christian Schmid) 

Markets require informed participants to function efficiently. This paper examines the impact of providing targeted information directly to patients on their purchasing-decisions regarding pharmaceutical drugs. We analyze the effect of informational letters sent by a Swiss health insurer to clients who had recently purchased a brand-name drug, informing them of available generic alternatives and potential savings. Utilizing the quasi-randomized timing of the letter dispatch, we employ an event study design with staggered treatment adoption to estimate the causal effect of patient information on generic substitution probability. Based on 540,000 drug purchases by 60,000 patients we find that the probability of switching to a generic alternative increases by almost 30 percentage points immediately after receiving the informational letter, representing nearly a fourfold rise in the substitution likelihood among previous brand-name drug buyers. Furthermore, the effect does not substantially depend on whether patients face a copayment for their drug purchase and thus personally financially benefit from switching. Our results highlight the limits of healthcare policies that rely solely on financial incentives, particularly if patients lack sufficient information in their decision-making.

### Christmas Shopping in the Prescription Drug Market (with Michael Gerfin)
Many modern health insurance contracts consist of a combination of deductibles, varying co-insurance rates and a stop-loss. While these features aim at solving the trade-off between risk protection and maintaining incentives, they also create nonlinear price-schedules. Using detailed individual level claims data from a large Swiss health insurer, we analyse the extent to which patients respond to the discrete increase in the spot price induced by the deductible reset at the beginning of each year. Especially, we focus on whether and to what extent chronically ill patients intertemporarily substitute prescription drug purchases. Employing a regression-discontinuity-design, we find that patients increase their chronic prescription drug purchases by around 50% on average at the end of a year, when they face a temporarily low marginal price. In contrast, we find only a minor and statistically insignificant effect for antibiotics. These findings show that at least some patients heavily react to the spot price. Thus, indicating that they don't understand the entire complexity of the nonlinear contract as their expected end-of-year price hardly changes.
